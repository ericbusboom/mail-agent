{% if messages %}
Here are the email(s) to analyze:

{% for message in messages %}
---
Email {{ loop.index }}:
From: {{ message.from_address }}
To: {{ message.to_address }}
Subject: {{ message.subject }}
Date: {{ message.send_time }}

{% if message.body %}
Body:
{{ message.body }}
{% else %}

{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

For each email, please provide:
1. A concise summary of the email content
2. Up to 5 categories that could be used to classify this email
3. Determine if this email is a reply to an email sent by the user or someone in their organization (same email domain)
4. Assess if this is a cold business prospecting email
5. Determine if this email is a marketing or promotional email
5. Determine if this email is related to business operations (accounting, healthcare, business filings, legal communication, taxes, etc.)
6. Evaluate if the subject of the email is time-sensitive

Some notes about proper categories: 

* Only mark an email as promotion ( 'is_promotion' ) if the email encourages the recepient to 
purchase something or visit a website or perform a commercial action. Some things that are not 
promotion are: Let's Encrypt certificate notices, grant opportunity notices, payroll time 
announcements from Gusto, calls for submitting papers to conferences, website security updates, 
updates from websites like Meetup or Github. Requests to perform an action, such as purchase or 
subscription, to a commercial, retail or media site are promotions. 

* Cold Business prospecting emails are requests to consider a business promotion or service, such 
as: rooftop solar, business financing, social media consulting, services to "get more customers", 
increase sales leads, marketing services, offers to look at a case study. The messages will often
mention "I haven't heard back" or "just following up on my last email" or "I know you are busy now".
